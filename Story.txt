[Ananya] Once upon a time, there was a very lonely old woman who lived all by herself in a mansion.
She didn't have any connections to the outside world because she had no friends or family.
In her spare time she was pursuing her degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, virtually, in Computer Science and Neurobiology.
She also enjoyed playing the guitar and piano. 
Other than that, she didn't have much to do since she had no connections.
She decided one day, that she would go down to her basement and tidy it up since it was full of old items.
She decided she would put her rock collection next to her book collection so that it would be ordered properly.
After a few hours, she had organized the basement to her liking.
The next day, she decided she wanted to go back down to the basement to go grab a book.
When she went downstairs, she realized her basement didn't look anything like how she had organized it the day prior.
Her books were all over the floor and her rock collection was completely missing!
She decided to explore to see if she could figure out how this happened.
